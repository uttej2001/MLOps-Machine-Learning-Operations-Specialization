# Introduction To Python

_Python Essentials for MLOps - week 1: Introdution to Python_

In this week, I learnt how to effectively use variables, logic, and Pythonâ€™s data structures to load, persist, and iterate over data. I applied these data structures to solve different problems as well as extract data from them.
